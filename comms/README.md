# Pre-workshop communication

Workshop participants need to complete some setup prior to a workshop, namely: 

1. Have a recent version of R
2. Have a recent version of RStudio
3. Set up git and GitHub, connect to RStudio, and create a GitHub PAT

To facilitate the pre-work, we send out an email at least 10 days in advance
with instructions. We also create a thread on RStudio Community where people can
get help if they need it. Templates for the email and Community post are in this
folder.
