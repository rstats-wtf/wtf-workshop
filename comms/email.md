Hello everyone,

We're looking forward to seeing you all at the What They Forgot to Teach You About R workshop at {LOCATION} on {DATES}. This email covers important setup that you'll need to do before the workshop.

To fully participate in the workshop, you'll need to bring with you a laptop you can install R packages on and that has:

1. A recent version of R (we recommend 3.6+)
2. A recent version of RStudio (we recommend 1.2.5000+; versions earlier than 1.1 will _not_ work)
3. Git and GitHub set up and connected to RStudio

Instructions on the necessary git and GitHub setup are here: https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up. Completing this will take at least 1-2 hours, and really does need to be done before the workshop starts.

We are happy to help if you run into any issues. Please post questions on {COMMUNITY THREAD} and one of us will get back to you there.
