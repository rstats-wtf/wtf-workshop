Hi! We are excited for the 1-day What They Forgot To Teach You About R workshop! This workshop requires that you work with your personal laptop and that you have relevant software installed and configured prior to the workshop start.

1. Please be ready with current versions of both R and RStudio. This means R>= 4.3.1 and RStudio >= 2023.06.1+524, unless you have a good reason otherwise. See the discussion in Install or upgrade R and RStudio: https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html#install-r-rstudio

2. It is essential that you do the requested pre-workshop Git/GitHub set up in advance: https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up

3. Install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), optionally with R language support (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r).


If you have questions in advance of the workshop, please ask on the Posit Community thread: https://community.rstudio.com/t/what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-about-r-workshop-posit-conf-2023/170506


See you soon,
Shannon and David
