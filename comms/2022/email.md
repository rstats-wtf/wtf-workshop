For this workshop, participants will be working from their personal laptops.

Please be ready with current versions of both R and RStudio. This means R>= 4.2.0 and RStudio >= 2022.02.3+492, unless you have a good reason otherwise. See the discussion in Install or upgrade R and RStudio: https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html#install-r-rstudio

In addition, it is essential that you do the requested pre-workshop Git/GitHub set up in advance: https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up

Lastly, please make sure your system is ready to build packages. You can confirm this by checking if `devtools::has_devel()` returns _Your system is ready to build packages!_.
If this returns _Could not find tools necessary to compile a package_ please follow instructions in What They Forgot to Teach You About R [Ch 9: Set up an R dev environment](https://rstats.wtf/set-up-an-r-dev-environment.html#set-up-an-r-dev-environment).

If you have questions in advance of the workshop, please ask on the RStudio Community thread: https://community.rstudio.com/t/what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-about-r-workshop-rstudio-conf-2022/138999
