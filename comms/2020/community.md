This post describes pre-workshop setup necessary for the workshop:

What They Forgot to Teach You About R
at {LOCATION}
{DATES}

It's all about Git + GitHub + RStudio (the pre-workshop setup, that is).

This truly requires your attention before the morning of {FIRST DAY}. We want to show you how to use Git/GitHub in your life as an R-using data analyst, which means we can't afford to get bogged down in a hot mess of Git installation issues. Let's try to work through them beforehand.

Do what's listed here: https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up

This is the thread to use if you need some help.

If you wonder why we've chosen to include Git/GitHub in this workshop, you might want to read [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/).

Go forth and install Git! :boom:
